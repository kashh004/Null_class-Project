# Possum Dataset Correlation Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the possum dataset by computing the correlation matrix for the numeric features and visualizing it using a heatmap.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationships between various numeric features in the possum dataset using correlation analysis. The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, and a heatmap is generated to visually represent the correlations between the features.

### Key Features:
- Loads and cleans the dataset (`possum.csv`).
- Computes the correlation matrix for numeric columns.
- Visualizes the correlations using a heatmap with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

## File Contents

- **`AI project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, cleaning it, and generating a heatmap of the correlation matrix.
